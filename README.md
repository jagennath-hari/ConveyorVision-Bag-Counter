# ConveyorVision-Bag-Counter

## üìÑ Abstract
<div align="justify">
ConveyCount is an innovative real-time system designed to automate the counting and tracking of cement bags on conveyor belts. Utilizing cutting-edge deep learning techniques like YOLOv8 for object detection and Byte tracker for precise tracking, ConveyCount accurately monitors cement bags as they traverse the conveyor belt.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install
1) Create conda env
2) Install dependencies into env
3) Annotate your datasets of cement bag. A good online data annotation tool is [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) or [VGG Image Annotator](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/). A `data.yaml` file must get created along with `train`, `valid` and  `test` folders containing the images and labels.
4) Follow [Official Link](https://docs.ultralytics.com) to train network and generate `yolo8.pt` file with your network architecture of choice, along with your dataset.
